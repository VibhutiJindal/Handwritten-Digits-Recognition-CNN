# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition-CNN

To build a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to recognize handwritten digits.

What is Covolutional Neural Network

A convolutional neural network is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

# Steps

1) Loading the dataset

2) Data Analysis and Visualization
